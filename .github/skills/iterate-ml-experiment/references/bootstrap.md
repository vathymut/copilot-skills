# Bootstrap — full procedure

The first session in an ML workspace. SKILL.md § 0 has the compact
version; this file has the full procedure with examples.

A workspace is in bootstrap mode when one of:

- `journal/JOURNAL.md` is missing.
- `journal/JOURNAL.md` is the one-line placeholder dropped by
  `organize-ml-workspace`.
- `journal/JOURNAL.md` exists but has no rows in History.

In bootstrap, the session-start ritual does **not** apply (no last
experiment to summarize, no backlog). Instead:

## Step 1 — Scaffold first if needed

If the workspace itself isn't in place (no `src/`, no `experiments/`,
no `journal/`), hand off to `organize-ml-workspace`. Come back here
when its placeholder `JOURNAL.md` exists.

## Step 2 — Rewrite `JOURNAL.md` from this skill's template

Read `templates/JOURNAL.md` and write it to `journal/JOURNAL.md`,
replacing the placeholder. **This skill — not
`organize-ml-workspace` — owns design-note content.**

## Step 3 — Derive a goal default from `data/README.md`

Read `data/README.md` (or whatever dataset card / problem statement
sits at the project root) **before** asking the user. Synthesize
one sentence of the form:

> "minimize `<metric>` on `<split>` for `<task description>`"

Propose it; the user confirms or amends. **Do not prompt with a
blank.** If no README / dataset card exists, then ask — but make
that the exception, not the default.

## Step 4 — Auto-draft `journal/01_baseline.md` via the consultation chain

The baseline is forced, not invented — but its defaults come from
sibling skills, not from memory:

- **Learner default**: consult `build-ml-pipeline` for what a
  "baseline" means for the data shape (tabular regression /
  classification → `skrub.tabular_pipeline`; other shapes have
  their own defaults).
- **Splitter default**: consult `evaluate-ml-pipeline` for the
  cross-validator default (typically `KFold` for IID tabular, but
  the skill picks based on data structure).
- **Metric default**: consult `python-api` for what
  `skore.evaluate` reports by default for the task type.

### Mismatch handling

If any default conflicts with the project goal — e.g., the README
requires Squared Error but skore's default is RMSE; the dataset
has 1M rows and 5-fold KFold may be slow / OOM — **flag it in the
Risks section** of `01_baseline.md`. Don't silently override the
default; surface the tension to the user.

## Step 5 — The user's role: approve or amend, not invent

Skip the strategy dispatch entirely for the baseline. The user
reads the auto-drafted design note and either approves or asks
for amendments.

## Step 6 — Exit bootstrap

Once `01_baseline.md` is approved and recorded in `JOURNAL.md`
History, the workspace exits bootstrap. Every session afterwards
uses § 1 of `SKILL.md` (Session start, iterate mode).

## Bootstrap skips the sourcing menu — NOT the config gates

The most common bootstrap failure shape is the agent treating
"bootstrap = forced baseline" as "bootstrap = silent everything".
**Wrong.** Bootstrap forbids the sourcing menu only; every other
gate the workflow normally fires still fires.

### Skipped in bootstrap (by design)

- Sourcing menu (`skore` / `user` / `my-pick` / `B<N>`) — no prior
  report, no backlog, no history.
- "Resume / record outcome / propose next" pick from § 1 — no last
  experiment, three branches ill-defined.

### MUST still fire in bootstrap — config gates

| Gate ID | Picks | Owning skill | When it fires |
|---------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| `G-PKG-NAME` | `src/<pkg>/` import name | `organize-ml-workspace` | **Before** any `pyproject.toml` / `pixi.toml` creation |
| `G-ENV-MGR` | Python env manager (`pixi`, `uv`, `poetry`, `hatch`, `conda`, `pip+venv`) + feature/group/env scope | `python-env-manager` | **Before** any `pixi init` / `pixi add` / equivalent |
| `G-TABULAR` | Tabular library (`pandas` / `polars`) + other Tier 2 contested-library picks | `data-science-python-stack` | **Before** any `Write` of `data.py` / experiment script importing the contested library |
| `G-CV-SPLITTER` | Cross-validator family for `skore.evaluate` (`KFold`, `StratifiedKFold`, `GroupKFold`, `TimeSeriesSplit`, ...) | `evaluate-ml-pipeline` | **Before** any `Write` of `src/<pkg>/evaluate.py`; mandatory even when `split_kwargs` is empty (the empty case is itself a justified pick) |
| `G-DESIGN` | Explicit user approval of `journal/01_baseline.md` | `iterate-ml-experiment` § 3 | **Before** any `Write` of `experiments/01_baseline.py` / `src/<pkg>/*.py` content authored from the design note |
| `G-RUN` | "Run now" vs "leave for later" once smoke tests pass | `iterate-ml-experiment` § 3 | **Before** the shell call that executes `experiments/01_baseline.py` |

Each gate's owning skill is responsible for the actual
`AskUserQuestion` mechanics; this table is the **bootstrap
contract** that says they all still fire even though the sourcing
menu doesn't. Every persistent gate's answer is recorded in
`JOURNAL.md` Status `Workspace decisions` (the first four) so a
later session can read the decision instead of re-asking.
`G-DESIGN` and `G-RUN` are per-experiment, not persistent — they
fire fresh on every experiment.

### Free-text doesn't resolve config gates

A user message resolves a config gate **only if it names one of
the gate's options**. "Quick baseline" / "go fast" / "you pick" /
"whatever is standard" do NOT resolve any of the gates above;
they fall through to the structured `AskUserQuestion`.
